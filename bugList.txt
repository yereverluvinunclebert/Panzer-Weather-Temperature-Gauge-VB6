addTargetFile source path empty then uses current app.path
All TwinBasic changes implemented as per clock/calendar

test the repoll functionality
move the weather code to a separate module.bas or a class - remove the temperature stuff to another class?
create pictorial gauge
pass the weather icon image information to the pictorial gauge for display
clouds: none     visibility not impaired
add windicon

pictorial gauge extra showers/wind icons
pictorial gauge green lamp showing good METAR poll
pictorial gauge right click menu display, then the gauge moves, should be a fix for that we can apply to the other gauges.
pictorial gauge stop/restart remove functionality
pictorial gauge tooltips, buttons

TODO:

barometer face incorrect for in HG - recalc the values on the face
barometer face incorrect for mm HG - recalc the values on the face
the correct gauge faces are on the G5

Barometer display not showing 23-31 inches of Hg face

rainfall indicator lamp & print out - cater for recent restart and current rain




pictorial gauge time to next update rotator - get it to rotate as per one of the other gauge pointers

if storm, flash lamp using timers

pressure drop alarm - test

fix population of the RC6 combobox - wip

think about removing some global vars and changing them to properties in the new overlay, should be possible to incorporate with the above

tiny tooltips resolve this with Olaf?, the width of the tooltips should expand with the font size and the width not be limited to one font size

refactor to use just one cwOverlay file instead of one overlay per each gauge - analyse

refactor to create a 'gauge' class instead of a specific gauge form per type

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.
