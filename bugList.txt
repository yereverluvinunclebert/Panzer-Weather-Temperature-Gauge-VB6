TODO

change barometer percentage code when above 800 - wip

when the device wakes from sleep, then poll need to test - wip

add the clipboard clock hands functionality

anemometer gauge face red and green areas replaced
anemometer gauge add Purple lamp - Extreme sustained speeds greater than 58 mph, or frequent wind gusts greater than 58 mph. Damaging wind conditions are consistent with a high wind warning.
Red lamp - High sustained speeds of 40 to 57 mph. Wind conditions consistent with a high wind warning.
Amber lamp - sustained speeds of 26 to 39 mph, or frequent wind gusts of 35 to 57 mph. Wind conditions consistent with a wind advisory.

move the weather code to a separate module.bas or a class - remove the temperature stuff to another class?
refactor to use just one cwOverlay file

think about removing some global vars and changing them to properties in the new overlay

add the pictorial gauge

fix population of the RC6 combobox - wip

add a rainfall alarm

tiny tooltips for other gauges?

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.
