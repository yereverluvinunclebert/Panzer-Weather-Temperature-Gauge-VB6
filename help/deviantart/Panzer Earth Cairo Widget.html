<img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="../help/sauron.png">I
have just created a new widget, my first for a few years. I'm not
planning to get into 'widgeting' again in a big way, I'm just
experimenting with a new technology, new to me at least. This new
technology is the combination of VB6 and a 'wrapper' around the Cairo
graphics library that gives you access to some graphical capabilities
that VB6 never had. In the case of this widget it is the transparency
of images and backgrounds that I am using to create a rotating earth on
a dieselpunk gauge. This Cairo wrapper was written by a VB6 guru by the
name of Olaf Schmidt, a clever chap indeed. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
You can see the rotating earth widget there alongside all my older
javascript widgets. It operates in a similar fashion to the others. If
you fancy modifying it yourself I will release the source on github.
There is nothing yet to download as I am still testing it myself on
Win7/10 and 11. This is just a heads-up! I'll pop a note here when it
is done.<br>

Panzer Earth Widget is a simple utility displaying a rotating earth
in a dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed
anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your
desktop a dieselpunk make-over. This help file describes just the
rotating earth widget and not the other widgets shown above.&nbsp;
Right-click on the widget to display the function menu, mouse hover
over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works
well on Windows XP to Windows 11.<br>

<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer%20Earth%20gauge%20VB6/help/sauron.png">When you
install and run the
widget for the first time it will present you with the licence screen
and launch the prefs. You must accept the licence terms to proceed
further. The Preference screen allows you to configure the
functionality of &nbsp;the rotating globe component of the Panzer
Earth
'widget'. The Rotating earth will also appear on your main monitor,
animating slowly using minimal resources. This widget's functionality
is limited as it is just a template for widgets yet to come, however,
it can be increased in size, animation speed can be changed,
opacity/transparency may be set as to the user's discretion. The widget
can also be made to hide for a pre-determined period. If the
application is already running then you can double-click to run a new
instance of the binary and you will have two or more globes running on
the desktop.<br>

<h3>The Preferences:</h3>

configuration of the widget is performed using the preference utility.
It is an approximate analogue of the Yahoo widget preferences screen
and replicates some of its functionality.<br>

a template. It contains all the fundamental code I need to create more.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
